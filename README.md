# Urban Traffic Dynamics Simulation

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a graph-based urban traffic simulation model, designed as part of the project "Modeling Urban Traffic Dynamics" for the CSE 6730 course (Fall 2024).

## Project Description

The project utilizes graph theory and numerical simulations to model and visualize traffic flow dynamics in urban environments. Intersections and roadways are represented as graph nodes and directed edges, respectively, while traffic density is propagated through the network using dynamic updates. Key methodologies include:

- **Graph Representation:** Using adjacency and Laplacian matrices to structure urban road networks.
- **Traffic Flow Dynamics:** Simulated through ordinary differential equations (ODEs) solved using the Runge-Kutta method.
- **Visualization:** Traffic densities are visualized across time steps to analyze congestion and flow patterns.


## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into traffic patterns using density distributions, congestion trends, and spatial metrics.
- **Validation Metrics:** Evaluation using the GEH statistic, time-series analysis, and scatter plots for comparing simulated and observed data.
- **Future Work Proposals:** Recommendations for enhancing the model, including stochastic elements and real-time data integration.
